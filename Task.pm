=head1 NAME

App::HWD::Task - Tasks for HWD

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Used only by the F<hwd> application.

Note that these functions are pretty fragile, and do almost no data
checking.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=cut

use warnings;
use strict;
use DateTime::Format::Strptime;

=head2 App::HWD::Task->new( { args } )

Creates a new task from the args passed in.  They should include at
least I<level>, I<name> and I<id>, even if I<id> is C<undef>.

    my $task = App::HWD::Task->new( {
        level => $level,
        name => $name,
        id => $id,
        estimate => $estimate,
    } );

}

=head2 App::HWD::Task->parse( $input_line, $parent_task )

Returns an App::HWD::Task object from an input line.

=head2 $task->is_todo()

Returns true if the task still has things to be done on it.  If the task
has no estimates, because it's a roll-up or milestone task, this is false.

=head2 started()

Returns whether the task has been started.  Doesn't address the question
of whether the task is completed or not, just whether work has been done

=head2 sort_work

Make sure all the work for a task is sorted so we can tell what was done when.

=cut

sub sort_work {
    my $self = shift;

    my $work = $self->{work};

    @$work = sort {

=head2 subtask_walk( $callback )

Recursively walks the tree of subtasks for the task, calling C<$callback>
for each subtask, like so:

    $callback->( $subtask )

=cut

sub subtask_walk {
    my $self = shift;
    my $callback = shift;

    for my $child ( $self->children ) {
