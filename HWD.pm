App::HWD - The great new App::HWD!

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.07_01

our $VERSION = '0.07_01';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module is nothing more than a place-holder for the version info and the TODO list.

=head1 TODO

=over 4

=item * Show totals in --started

=item * Show task history

=item * Show tasks that are too big.

=item * Show tasks that have gone over

=item * Add a way to delete tasks that we don't want.

=item * Add a way to put in comment text.

=item * BUG: Bruce's open tasks aren't complete

=item * Weekly burndown

The C<--burndown> flag gives totals as they happen.  I want them to give
a Monday-morning total since I like to plot weekly, not daily.
