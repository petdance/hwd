        [THINGS THAT MIGHT BREAK YOUR CODE]
        * Dates must now be in YYYY-MM-DD format.

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * Added --todo option to show only those items needing to be done.
        * Now handles fractional estimates.
        * Now handles deletion dates.  We don't DO anything with them,
          but they're legal, and burndown ignores them.
        * Franctional estimates and velocities in the main listing now
          show as "+" rather than the decimals.  For example, "12"
          shows as "12", but "12.5" shows as "12+".

        [FIXES]
        * No longer double-counts tasks worked on by multiple people
          in --started.
        * Doesn't print a total when a --started person is specified.

        [THINGS THAT MIGHT BREAK YOUR CODE]
        * Previously, a task that was added after coding started was
          noted like this:

            --Implement widget (#251, 4hrs, @11/7/05)

          Now, we use the word "added" instead of "@"

            --Implement widget (#251, 4hrs, added 11/7/05)

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * Added whitespace to --started output.
        * Gives total points open on --started.

        [FIXES]
        * Fixed potentially destructive bug in a test file:

            unlink($started, qr#Chimp is working on.+ 107 - Refactor \(1/1\)#s);

          That "unlink" is, of course, supposed to be "unlike".  OOPS!

        [INTERNALS]
        * Removed code for handling --detail_level
        * bin/hwd now has no globals.
        * Added many items to TODO list.

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * Added a vim syntax file in etc/hwd.vim.
        * Added --burndown and starting on the burndown graphic.
          Thanks to Neil & Luke again.
        * Added a $task->date_added()
