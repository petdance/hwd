Revision history for App-HWD

NEXT    
        [THINGS THAT MIGHT BREAK YOUR CODE]
        * Previously, a task that was added after coding started was
          noted like this:

            --Implement widget (#251, 4hrs, @11/7/05)

          Now, we use the word "added" instead of "@"

            --Implement widget (#251, 4hrs, added 11/7/05)

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * Added whitespace to --started output.
        * Gives total points open on --started.

        [FIXES]
        * Fixed potentially destructive bug in a test file:

            unlink($started, qr#Chimp is working on.+ 107 - Refactor \(1/1\)#s);

          That "unlink" is, of course, supposed to be "unlike".  OOPS!

        [INTERNALS]
        * Removed code for handling --detail_level
        * bin/hwd now has no globals.
        * Added many items to TODO list.
